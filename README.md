Every time I create a little project I need a simple and useful Makefile for it, so here it is!  
  
It works with source files stored in src folder (SRC_DIR variable), header files in include folder (INCLUDE), etc.  
  
As of now it doesn't work with any libs, but it can be simply added.  
  
I don't think that it's worth any licenses:) Just tell me, please, that you liked it.
